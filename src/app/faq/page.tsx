    question: "What e-commerce platforms does Customizer Studio support?",
    answer: "Currently, Customizer Studio seamlessly integrates with Shopify and WooCommerce (WordPress). We are actively working on expanding support for other major platforms like BigCommerce, Wix, and Squarespace. Stay tuned for updates!"
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a free trial or a free plan?",
    answer: "Yes! Customizer Studio offers a 'Free' plan that allows you to explore basic customization features for one product. We also typically offer a 14-day free trial for our paid plans so you can experience the full power of Customizer Studio before committing."
  },
  {
    question: "How easy is it to install Customizer Studio on my website?",
    answer: "It's very straightforward! For most platforms, you can simply copy and paste a small JavaScript snippet into your product page template. For Shopify and WooCommerce, we are developing dedicated apps/plugins to make this process even simpler, often just a few clicks."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I customize the look and feel of the customizer tool?",
    answer: "While the core functionality is standardized for a consistent user experience, you will have options to match the customizer's basic color scheme to your brand. More advanced white-labeling and CSS customization options are planned for our higher-tier plans."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of support do you offer?",
    answer: "We offer community support for our Free plan users. Paid plans include email support, with priority email support and dedicated account management options available for our Pro and Enterprise tiers."
  },
  {
    question: "How are custom orders handled by my store?",
    answer: "When a customer completes a customization, the details of their design (text, uploaded images, chosen options) are passed along with the order to your e-commerce platform. You'll receive this information in the order notes or via a dedicated panel, allowing your fulfillment team to produce the custom item accurately."
