# For local development:
# Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Gemini API key.
# Do NOT commit your actual API key to version control if this file is not in .gitignore.
#
# For PRODUCTION (Firebase App Hosting):
# This key MUST be set as an environment variable in your
# Firebase App Hosting backend configuration via the Firebase Console.
# Variable name: GEMINI_API_KEY
# Value: Your actual Gemini API key
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

# NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables are accessible on the client-side
# Ensure your Firebase config variables are correctly prefixed if they need to be
# (though for backend API keys like Gemini, they should NOT be NEXT_PUBLIC_).
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_client_api_key

# Your existing Firebase public config variables:
# (These are usually set by Firebase CLI or during project setup,
# and should be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_ if used in client-side code.
# If they are only used by the backend, they don't need the prefix but
# must be set as environment variables in App Hosting for production.)

# Ensure the Firebase related environment variables loaded by your app
# (e.g., in src/lib/firebase.ts) are available.
# Typically:
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
